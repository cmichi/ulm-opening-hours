# ulm-opening-hours

This is an idea, I had a while ago. I didn't get around to implement 
it but took the upcoming [Open Data Day](http://ulmapi.de/#opendataday)
as an opportunity to work on it.

The goal of this project is to create a website which can be used to answer
questions like "*Which shops/bakeries/restaurants/etc. are still open?*" or
"*Where can I get beer at this time?*".

The data which is used will for now be exported from the OSM project.


# Libraries
